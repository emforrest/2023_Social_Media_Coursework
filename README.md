## My Object-Oriented Programming module coursework, to create the back end of a hypothetical social media platform

In Term 2 of my first year at university, I was assigned coursework for the Object Oriented Programming module, which constituted 100% of the mark for this module. It was a pair programming exercise, meaning my friend Jack (https://www.github.com/Lonk2004) and I contributed evenly to this project. We would take it in turns being the driver (pair member who is actively coding) and observer (pair member who is watching, checking syntax and helping to discuss the code and our plans). 

The task was to create a functioning backend for a hypothetical social media platform in Java. This included creating accounts and posts, and allowing users to make comments on other user's posts or endorse a post (similar to a retweet on Twitter). 

***It implemented an interface provided to us by the module leader. Our code is that in the files SocialMedia.java, Account.java, Post.java, Comment.java, Endorsement.java and SocialMediaPlatformTestApp.java; the other files were provided.***

Included in this repository are: the .java and .class source files; an iteration of our testing file (which was not required in the submission); a javadoc documenting our app using the documentation comments we provided; a pdf printout of the source code we created; and the cover page, which anonymously documented who was the driver and observer each time we met up to code(I was 234689 for reference).

We agreed to weight the coursework 50:50, so both of us achieved the same grade, which was 81/100.
